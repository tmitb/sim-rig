# Simulator Rigs
This repository contains projects related to simulator rigs such as Racing or Flight simulators. Most of the content is to keep the progress and history of the changes that I personally made to my own rigs. Along the way of the changes, I create smaller projects within them to have more details about them.

The current idea is to have two separate projects, one for Racing sim and another for Flight sim, as sub modules so I can have them in two distinct places and manage them separately. Things may evolve into other things like VR/AR/XR space because they are generally related, at least in the context of the way I am using them, but there is no solid plan for them as of yet.

# License
Each submodule has its own license, and projects inside each submodule also have their own as well. Alwasy check the LICENSE file to exactly know what the license is.

However, 3D models in general are CC BY-SA 4.0, and software portions are usually MIT License. Again, check exact project root for the correct license.
